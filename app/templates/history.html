        Tottenham Hotspur, commonly referred to as Spurs, was founded in 1882 in North London. Over the decades, the club has established itself as one of the most storied teams in English football. In 1961, Spurs became the first team in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, a landmark accomplishment in English football history. Spurs continued their success on the European stage by becoming the first British club to win a European trophy, clinching the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1963.

        In recent years, Spurs have continued to grow, both on and off the field. The opening of their world-class Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019 marked a transformative moment for the club. That same year, under the management of Mauricio Pochettino, Spurs reached the UEFA Champions League final for the first time in their history, falling just short against Liverpool. Today, the club remains a key competitor in the Premier League and European competitions, continuing to chase further glory.
